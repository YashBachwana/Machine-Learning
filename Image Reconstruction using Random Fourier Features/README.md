# Image Reconstruction using Random Fourier Features (RFF)

This project demonstrates the application of Random Fourier Features (RFF) for image reconstruction tasks. The repository includes three Jupyter Notebooks that cover different aspects of image reconstruction using RFF.

## Contents

1. **RFF_CompletingImage.ipynb**  
   This notebook explores image completion techniques using Random Fourier Features. It highlights how RFF can be utilized to fill in missing parts of images effectively.

2. **RFF_ImageReconstruction.ipynb**  
   In this notebook, we compare image reconstruction techniques using linear regression with polynomial features against RFF. The results illustrate the advantages of using RFF for image reconstruction tasks.

3. **RFF_Superresolution_Qualitative_Analysis.ipynb**  
   This notebook performs qualitative analysis of image super-resolution techniques leveraging Random Fourier Features. It showcases the visual enhancements achieved through RFF-based methods.

Size of the image chosen for the experiments depends the computational resources available. The above notebooks specifies the image size used in the experiments, which utilizes NVIDIA RTX A4000.
